# 💝 Valentine's Day Proposal

Demo: https://my-valentine-day-gift.netlify.app/

A fun, interactive React application designed to prank your special someone on Valentine's Day! 

## ✨ Features

- **Playful "no" Button**: The "no" button is elusive! It moves away when hovered and changes its text to tease the user ("Please yes 🥰", "think again 😃").
- **The "yes" Button Twist**: Clicking "No" is actually the way to proceed... but wait for the surprise!
- **will you handle my miscellaneous expenses**: Instead of a romantic acceptance, the user is greeted with an "kanna'ah surukatha" message and a funny video.
- **Visual Effects**: 
  - Floating hearts background animation.
  - Continuous confetti celebration on the success screen.
  - Glassmorphism card design.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile (though chasing the button is more fun with a mouse!).

## 🛠️ Built With

- **React** (Vite)
- **Canvas Confetti** for celebrations
